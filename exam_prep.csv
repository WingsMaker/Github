82,1,
82,1,"In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point to train a new model on a different task, typically using a smaller dataset. "
82,1,"The pre-trained model contains weights that have been learned from a large amount of data on a related task, and these weights can be leveraged to train the new model more efficiently."

86,0,BlazingText
86,1,Correct Answer
86,1,A. K-means clustering
86,1,Explanation
86,1,K-means clustering should be used to complete this work because it is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for clustering data. It is suitable for this task because the dataset consists of unlabeled data and the goal is to classify the data into different buckets. K-means clustering works by partitioning the data into k clusters based on their similarity. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids until convergence. This algorithm is widely used for data clustering and can help the Machine Learning Specialist in this task.
87,0,A large JSON dataset for a project has been uploaded to a private Amazon S3 bucket. The Machine Learning Specialist wants to securely access and explore the data from an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. A new VPC was created and assigned to the Specialist. How can the privacy and integrity of the data stored in Amazon S3 be
87,0,maintained while granting access to the Specialist for analysis?
87,0,
87,0,A.
87,0,Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC with SageMaker-provided internet access enabled. Use an S3 ACL to open read privileges to the everyone group
87,0,
87,0,B.
87,0,Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to access the data. Copy the JSON dataset from Amazon S3 into the ML storage volume on the SageMaker notebook instance and work against the local dataset.

87,0,
87,0,D.
87,0,Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC with SageMaker-provided internet access enabled. Generate an S3 pre-signed URL for access to data in the bucket.
87,1,Correct Answer
87,1,C. Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to
87,1,"access the data, define a custom S3 bucket policy to only allow requests from your VPC to access the S3 bucket."
87,1,Explanation
87,1,The correct answer is to launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for
87,1,"the notebook to access the data, and define a custom S3 bucket policy to only allow requests from the VPC to access"
87,1,the S3 bucket. This ensures that the data stored in Amazon S3 remains private and can only be accessed by the
87,1,Specialist through the VPC and the designated notebook instance. The S3 VPC endpoint establishes a private
87,1,"connection between the VPC and S3, eliminating the need for internet access. The custom S3 bucket policy further"
87,1,"restricts access to the bucket, ensuring the integrity of the data."

You have been asked to design a system that augments your company's building access security by scanning the faces of people entering their buildings and recognizing the person as either an employee/contractor/consultant, who is in the company's database, or  visitor, who is not in their database. Across their many campus locations worldwide your company has over 750,000 employees and over 250,000 contractors and consultants. These workers are all registered in their HR database. Each of these workers has an image of their face stored in the HR database. You have decided to use Amazon Rekognition for your facial recognition solution.

88,1,Correct Answer
88,1,D. Face collection contents
88,1,Explanation
88,1,"The source of the problem could be the face collection contents. Since the Rekognition model is failing to recognize visitors, it is possible that the faces of the visitors are not included in the face collection that the system is comparing against. The face collection should ideally contain images of both employees/contractors/consultants and visitors in order to accurately identify and differentiate between them."

89,1,C. Use the Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm on the single time series consisting of the full year of data with a predictor_type of regressor.
89,1,Explanation
89,1,"The Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm is most likely to provide the best results in this scenario. The task is to forecast air quality based on historical data, which is a regression problem. The Linear Learner algorithm is designed for regression tasks and can effectively learn patterns and make predictions based on the given time series data. Using a regressor predictor_type will allow the algorithm to accurately forecast the air quality in parts per million of contaminants for the next 2 days.

90,0,D.
90,0,Do not change the learning rate. Increase the batch size.
90,1,Correct Answer
90,1,B. Reduce the batch size. Decrease the learning rate
90,1,Explanation
90,1,It is most likely that the loss function is very curvy and has multiple local minima where the training is
90,1,getting stuck. Decreasing the batch size would help the data scientist stochastically get out of the local minima
90,1,saddles. Decreasing the learning rate would prevent overshooting the global loss function minimum

99,1,"The company should launch the notebook instances in a private subnet and access the data through an S3 VPC endpoint. This setup ensures that the data is not transmitted across the internet, as required by the compliance policy. By using a private subnet, the instances are not accessible from the public internet. The S3 VPC endpoint allows the instances to securely access the S3 bucket within the VPC, without the need for internet connectivity. This ensures that the data remains within the company's network and complies with the compliance policy."

109,1,Correct Answer
109,1,B. Data normalization
109,1,Explanation
109,1,"Data normalization is the process of scaling the data to a standard range. In this case, the high magnitude of some features can cause the neural network to give more importance to those features, leading to slower convergence during backpropagation. By normalizing the data, the features will be on a similar scale, allowing the neural network to learn more effectively and converge faster. This helps to prevent any one feature from dominating the cost function and ensures better convergence during backpropagation."

111,1,"The PR Curve is the most suitable metric to determine the model best suited for the classification problem in this scenario. Since the data is skewed towards true negative results, precision and recall are more appropriate metrics than the ROC curve. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases. The PR Curve combines both precision and recall, providing a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance in identifying true positives."

119,1,Correct Answer
119,1,"B. As variable 1 increases, variable 5 decreases"
119,1,Explanation
119,1,"The correlation coefficient of -0.95 indicates a strong negative correlation between variable 1 and variable 5. This means that as variable 1 increases, variable 5 tends to decrease. The closer the correlation coefficient is to -1, the stronger the negative correlation. Therefore, the Data Scientist can interpret that there is a strong inverse relationship between variable 1 and variable 5."
